# JEMS-database-project

Project for CPSC 332 at CSUF

Our client named The Perfect Jem asked our company JEMS Inc. to design them
a database for their imperfect and imitation jewelry store. The capabilities of the
Database range from tracking inventory, storing customerâ€™s personal and payment
information, and recording orders. With regards to products the database stores product
and supplier information. In addition, the database keeps track of which customers are
members, what discount they receive on their purchase, and what products are
exclusive to them.
